1. Provide a detailed written description of your claim
2. Describe the relief you seek
3. Provide supporting documentation

This informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to any formal proceedings.

#### Step 2: Binding Arbitration (Mandatory)

**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**: YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE APP SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except as provided below.

**Arbitration Rules:**
- Arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules

- Participate in a class action lawsuit
- Serve as a private attorney general
- Participate in representative proceedings
- Consolidate your claims with claims of other users

**Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants in any action.**

If a court finds the class action waiver unenforceable, this entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void (but the rest of these Terms remain in effect).

### Jury Trial Waiver

**TO THE EXTENT ARBITRATION DOES NOT APPLY, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL FOR ANY DISPUTES.**

### Jurisdiction and Venue

If arbitration does not apply or is found unenforceable:
- You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware
- You waive any objection to venue or forum non conveniens
- You agree that such courts shall have personal jurisdiction over you

### Limitation on Time to File Claims

**ANY CLAIM MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CLAIM ARISES, OR IT IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.** This applies regardless of any statute of limitations to the contrary.

### Severability

If any provision of this dispute resolution section is found unlawful or unenforceable:
- That provision shall be severed
- The remainder of this section remains in full force
- The dispute shall proceed in court rather than arbitration

### Changes to Dispute Resolution

We may modify this dispute resolution section by providing notice. Changes will not apply to disputes that arose before the modification's effective date. By continuing to use the App, you agree to the modified dispute resolution terms.

## 14. Miscellaneous Provisions

### Entire Agreement
These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App.

### Severability
If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

### Waiver
Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right.

### Assignment
You may not transfer your rights or obligations. We may assign our rights and obligations to any party.

### Force Majeure
We are not liable for delays or failures due to causes beyond our reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, wars, strikes, internet outages).

### Survival
Provisions that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including ownership, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
